```

### Learning Workflow
```bash
# Understand new concepts
claude "Explain dependency injection in Python with examples"

# Code alternatives
claude "Show me 3 different ways to implement this:" < mycode.py

# Best practices
claude "What are the best practices for error handling in this code:" < error_handling.py
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Prompts
Create specialized prompts for different tasks:

```yaml
# ~/.config/claude_prompts/system_prompts.yaml
prompts:
  code_reviewer:
    name: "Code Reviewer"
    prompt: |
      You are a senior software engineer conducting a code review.
      Focus on:
      - Code quality and maintainability
      - Performance implications
      - Security vulnerabilities
      - Best practices adherence
      
  architect:
    name: "System Architect"
    prompt: |
      You are a system architect helping design software systems.
      Consider:
      - Scalability requirements
      - Technology trade-offs
      - Design patterns
      - System integration
```

### Integration Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/.local/bin/claude-review
# Quick code review script

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: claude-review <file>"
    exit 1
fi

cat "$1" | claude "Review this code for potential improvements, bugs, and best practices. Provide specific, actionable feedback."
```
